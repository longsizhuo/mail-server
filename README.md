# 🛠️ Health Check Service and Mail-Server 📧

This repository contains two core components for managing and maintaining a `📧 mail-server` application:

1️⃣ A **Bash-based 🖥️ health check service** that monitors the server’s health 🩺, attempts to restart 🔄 it if unresponsive, and sends email 📤 notifications upon repeated failures.
2️⃣ A **Go-based 🚀 server** that handles contact form 📋 submissions, saves messages 💾 to a database 🗄️, and sends emails 📧 using a local Postfix setup 📬.

**This system powers the email distribution functionality for [my resume website](https://me.longsizhuo.com)**. Special thanks to **Postfix** for enabling reliable email delivery. 🙏

These tools work together to ensure high availability ✅ and seamless operation ⚙️ of your mail server.

## 🌟 Features

### 🛠️ Health Check Service

- Periodic ⏰ health checks 🩺 for the `📧 mail-server`, ensuring continuous monitoring 👀 of service availability.
- Automatically restarts 🔄 the `📧 mail-server` if it becomes unresponsive 🚫, reducing downtime ⌛ without manual intervention.
- Sends email alerts 📤 if the service fails to recover after a threshold number of attempts ⚠️, enabling quick response 🏃‍♂️ from administrators.
- Automatically frees port 🔓 8181 if it is occupied by a rogue process 🛑, ensuring the service can bind to the required port.
- Provides detailed logging 📝 for troubleshooting 🔍 and monitoring the status of the service over time.

### 🚀 Mail-Server Application

- Handles `POST 📤 /contact` requests to accept form submissions containing user details 👤.
- Saves submitted messages 💾 to a MySQL database 🗄️ using GORM.
- Sends email notifications 📧 with form details 📋 to a configured recipient 📨 using the local `mail` command.
- Includes a `GET 📥 /health` endpoint for health checks 🩺, returning a simple status response ✅.
- Implements CORS 🌐 for secure cross-origin resource sharing 🔒.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- A Linux 🐧-based operating system to host 🖥️ the service and application.
- **For 🛠️ Health Check Script:**
  - Bash shell 💻 for running the script and automation tasks.
  - `curl` 🌐 for performing health checks on the configured URL endpoint 🔗.
  - `mail` command 📧 (e.g., part of `mailutils` or `postfix`) for sending email notifications 📤 to administrators.
  - Systemd ⚙️ for service management (optional but highly recommended ✅).
- **For 🚀 Mail-Server Application:**
  - Go environment 🚀 for building 🛠️ and running 🖥️ the application.
  - MySQL database 🗄️ for storing contact form submissions 📋.

## 📦 Installation

### 🚀 Mail-Server Application

1️⃣ Clone the repository 📂 from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/longsizhuo/mail-server.git
   cd mail-server
   ```

2️⃣ Navigate to the `📧 mail-server` source directory and build 🛠️ the application:

   ```bash
   go build -o mail-server
   ```

3️⃣ Deploy the `📧 mail-server` executable to a suitable location 📂:

   ```bash
   sudo cp mail-server /usr/local/bin/mail-server
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mail-server
   ```

4️⃣ Configure the MySQL database connection 🔗 in the `server.go` file or through environment variables 🌐. Ensure the database is set up and migrations are applied automatically ✅.

5️⃣ Start the server manually 🖥️ or configure it as a systemd service ⚙️ (see below).

### 🛠️ Health Check Script

1️⃣ Navigate to the health check script directory 📂:

   ```bash
   cd health_check
   ```

2️⃣ Make the script executable ✅:

   ```bash
   chmod +x health_check.sh
   ```

3️⃣ Edit 📝 the script `health_check.sh` to configure the following variables:
   - `URL`: The health check endpoint 🔗, which defaults to `http://localhost:8181/health`.
   - `CHECK_INTERVAL`: Interval ⏰ between health checks in seconds 🕒, defaulting to `10` seconds.
   - `FAIL_THRESHOLD`: The maximum number of consecutive failures allowed 🚨 before action is taken 🛠️, defaulting to `10` failures.
   - `EMAIL_TO`: The email address 📧 where alerts will be sent 📤 in case of service failures.
   - `EMAIL_SUBJECT` and `EMAIL_BODY`: Customizable subject and body of the alert email 📋.

4️⃣ Deploy the script as a systemd service ⚙️ or run it manually 🖥️ (see below).

## 📖 Usage

### 🚀 Running the Mail-Server Manually

```bash
mail-server
```

This starts 🏁 the server on `0.0.0.0:8181`. You can customize the port 🔧 or other configurations as needed.

### 🛠️ Running the Health Check Script Manually

```bash
./health_check.sh
```

This will start 🏁 the monitoring loop 🔄 and immediately begin checking the service health 🩺 based on the configured parameters. The logs 📝 will display in the terminal 🖥️ for real-time feedback.

### ⚙️ Setting Up as Systemd Services

#### 🚀 Mail-Server Service

1️⃣ Create a `systemd` service file 📂:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mail-server.service
   ```

2️⃣ Add the following content 📋:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=📧 Mail-Server Application
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mail-server
   Restart=always
   User=longsizhuo
   Environment=PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3️⃣ Reload systemd 🔄 and start 🏁 the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start mail-server
   sudo systemctl enable mail-server
   ```

#### 🛠️ Health Check Service

1️⃣ Create a `systemd` service file 📂:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/health_check.service
   ```

2️⃣ Add the following content 📋:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=🛠️ Health Check Service for Mail-Server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/bin/bash /path/to/health_check.sh
   Restart=always
   User=longsizhuo
   Environment=PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3️⃣ Reload systemd 🔄 and start 🏁 the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start health_check
   sudo systemctl enable health_check
   ```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- For `📧 mail-server`, ensure the database connection 🔗 is configured correctly and accessible 🌐. Check logs 📝 for any errors during startup or operation ⚠️.
- For the health check script 🛠️, ensure the `curl` 🌐 and `mail` 📧 commands are available and properly configured. Review logs 🔍 to debug failures 🚨.
- Use the following commands 🖥️ to check logs for either service:

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u mail-server
  sudo journalctl -u health_check
  ```
